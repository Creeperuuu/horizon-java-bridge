//! Whether this launcher-started game may run Fabric mods (docs/java-bridge.md, "Ownership").
//!
//! Fabric mods run on the player's own game jar, and their first start downloads Fabric Loader,
//! its libraries and Fabric API from Fabric's servers. That happens only when **the launcher
//! started the game for an account whose ownership of Minecraft: Java Edition was confirmed just
//! now**, and the game confirms it again itself:
//! - past its owner gate (`account::launch`, which asks the Minecraft services with the account's
//!   token), the launcher writes an **owner record** for this one start: the owner's profile UUID
//!   and Minecraft access token, in a fresh file only the player can read, in the launcher's data
//!   folder (`<launcher>/java-mods-owner/`), and passes its path in [`OWNER_VAR`] beside [`ARG`]
//!   (`launcher/src/java_variant.rs`, `switch_command`). It is the session file the launcher
//!   already hands the game (`--session-file`), written for the owner;
//! - the game reads the record once and deletes it ([`read_record`]): it must be fresh (written
//!   in the last [`RECORD_LIFE`]), the player's only, and name an account of the launcher's
//!   `accounts.json` beside its folder;
//! - for an offline record, the game skips Microsoft ownership checks entirely. It does not grant
//!   an online identity and cannot authenticate to online-mode multiplayer servers.
//!
//! [`ARG`] without a record that passes (the game started by hand, by another launcher, or with
//! the variables set by hand) runs no mods: the game says the launcher is needed and plays without
//! them, having downloaded nothing. The game itself never downloads anything of Mojang's (Java,
//! jars, assets), whoever starts it.
//!
//! Developers' harnesses (regress, `launch.sh`, `lan_e2e`, test servers) opt in with
//! `HORIZON_JAVA_MODS=1`, which exists only in builds with the `dev` feature
//! (`horizon-client/java-mods-dev`); release builds (`java-mods-release.yml`,
//! `package_java_variant.sh`) don't have it.
